# Runtime Architecture

## Context Boundaries

The extension runs in three isolated contexts, each with separate capabilities.

- `content` (`src/content/content-script.ts`, `src/content/picker.ts`, `src/content/parseElementText.ts`): handles interactive element picking, parses selected DOM text into a market payload, emits detection messages.
- `background` (`src/background/index.ts`): service worker that routes messages and performs privileged API orchestration.
- `sidepanel` (`src/sidepanel/*`): React UI state machine and rendering layer.

This separation is required by Manifest V3 and is also the reason all communication happens through `chrome.runtime` messaging.

## Entrypoints

- `manifest.json -> background.service_worker`: `src/background/index.ts`
- `manifest.json -> content_scripts.js`: `src/content/content-script.ts`
- `manifest.json -> side_panel.default_path`: `src/sidepanel/index.html`

## Responsibility Split

- Content script:
  - Wait for `START_PICKER` and activate an interactive picker on the current page.
  - Highlight candidate elements under the cursor using capture-phase listeners.
  - Resolve a candidate container via ancestor scoring/market-indicator heuristics.
  - Parse the selected candidate into one `DetectedMarket` via `parseElementText`.
  - Emit `MARKETS_DETECTED` (single-item array), `DETECTION_FAILED`, or `PICKER_CANCELLED`.
- Background service worker:
  - Enable open-on-action side panel behavior.
  - Relay picker detection messages (`MARKETS_DETECTED`, `DETECTION_FAILED`, `PICKER_CANCELLED`) and `EVENT_DETECTED` to side panel listeners.
  - Forward `START_PICKER` from side panel to active-tab content script.
  - Handle `REQUEST_ANALYSIS` by calling API client.
  - Normalize error outcomes into message types the UI can consume.
- Side panel:
  - Own local reducer state (`phase`, single `detectedEvent`, `result`, `error`, `user`) and phase transitions.
  - Subscribe to runtime messages via hooks.
  - Trigger analysis requests through background, never direct privileged orchestration.

## Lifecycle Notes

- Background is non-persistent (MV3 service worker lifecycle), so message handlers must stay stateless and deterministic.
- Side panel hooks attach listeners on mount and remove listeners on unmount.
- Picker activation is idempotent (`activatePicker()` returns early if already active).
- While picker is active, content script injects transient highlight/toast styles and capture-phase listeners; all are removed on selection/cancel.
